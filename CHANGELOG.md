## 0.6.0

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES
- **Lifecycle Standardization**: Renamed lifecycle methods for consistency
    - `ZenController.onDispose()` ‚Üí `ZenController.onClose()`
    - `ZenService.onDelete()` ‚Üí `ZenService.onClose()`
- **API Consistency**: `ZenScope.put()` parameter `permanent` ‚Üí `isPermanent`

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Automatic ZenService Disposal**: Services are automatically disposed when their scope is disposed (promotes proper scope design)
- **Enhanced ZenService Integration**: `ZenScope` now matches `Zen` API behavior for services
- **Smart Defaults**: ZenService instances default to permanent across all registration methods

### üîß Improvements
- Consistent lifecycle pattern: `onInit()` ‚Üí `onClose()` ‚Üí `dispose()`
- ZenService instances properly initialize from lazy factories
- Complete disposal coverage in all scope cleanup operations

### üîÑ Migration Guide
```
// Lifecycle methods
@override void onDispose() ‚Üí @override void onClose()
@override void onDelete() ‚Üí @override void onClose()

// Scope registration
scope.put(service, permanent: true) ‚Üí scope.put(service, isPermanent: true)
```

### üìù Internal Changes
- **Restructured ZenService disposal**: Added internal `dispose()` method that calls user's `onClose()`
- **Improved separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between user cleanup (`onClose()`) and framework disposal (`dispose()`)
- Updated all examples and documentation to use new lifecycle methods
- Enhanced error messages to reference correct method names

## 0.5.5
* **üÜï ZenService (long‚Äëlived services)**
    * Adds `ZenService` base with `onInit` and `onClose` lifecycle hooks
    * Safe init: `isInitialized` set only after successful `onInit`
    * Guaranteed cleanup via `onDelete` ‚Üí `onClose`

- **üß© DI behavior and consistency**
    * `Zen.put(instance)`: `ZenService` defaults to `isPermanent = true` and initializes via lifecycle manager
    * `Zen.putLazy(factory)`: explicit permanence (default `false`); instance created on first `find()`
    * `Zen.putFactory(factory)`: unchanged; always creates new instances
    * `Zen.find()`: auto‚Äëinitializes `ZenService` on first access (covers lazy/scoped resolutions)

- **‚úÖ Compatibility**
    * No changes to behavior `ZenController`
    * Works across scopes and modules with consistent lifecycle handling

- **üß™ Tests**
    * Added unit/integration tests for service init/disposal, lazy resolution, and error handling
